# BMad Method — Orchestrator Rules

## Workflow Execution Engine

The workflow execution engine governs all BMad workflow processing. Every workflow follows these rules.

### Core Mandates

- **Always read COMPLETE files** — NEVER use offset/limit when reading any workflow-related files
- **Instructions are MANDATORY** — either as file path, steps, or embedded list in YAML, XML, or markdown
- **Execute ALL steps in instructions IN EXACT ORDER**
- **Save to output file after EVERY template-output tag**
- **NEVER skip a step** — you are responsible for every step's execution without fail or excuse

### Step Execution Rules

1. Steps execute in exact numerical order (1, 2, 3...)
2. Optional steps: Ask user unless YOLO mode active
3. Template-output tags: Save content, discuss with user, NEVER proceed until user indicates to proceed (unless YOLO mode)

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Normal** | Full user interaction and confirmation of EVERY step at EVERY template output |
| **YOLO** | Skip all confirmations and elicitation, minimize prompts, produce workflow automatically by simulating expert user responses |

### User Options at Checkpoints

At each template-output checkpoint, the user can choose:
- **[a] Advanced Elicitation** — Start deep-dive elicitation techniques on current section
- **[c] Continue** — Proceed to next step
- **[p] Party-Mode** — Start multi-agent group discussion on current topic
- **[y] YOLO** — Auto-complete the rest of the document without further prompts

## Step-File Architecture

All multi-step BMad workflows use the step-file architecture pattern:

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self-contained instruction file that must be followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory — never load future step files until told to do so
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Steps must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed
- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array
- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: Only proceed to next step when user selects Continue
5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step
6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing final output for a step
- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input
- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps

## Workflow Configuration (workflow.yaml)

Every workflow has a configuration file that defines:

### Required Fields
- `name` — Workflow identifier
- `description` — What the workflow does
- `config_source` — Path to module config (REQUIRED for all modules)

### Common Fields
- `instructions` — Path to instruction file (markdown, XML, or embedded)
- `validation` — Path to validation checklist
- `template` — Path to output template (or `false` for action-only workflows)
- `default_output_file` — Where to write the output document
- `installed_path` — Base path for the workflow's files

### Input File Patterns
Workflows can define `input_file_patterns` for smart document discovery:

```yaml
input_file_patterns:
  prd:
    whole: "{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md"
    sharded: "{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/*.md"
    load_strategy: "FULL_LOAD"
  epics:
    whole: "{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md"
    sharded_single: "{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/epic-{{epic_num}}.md"
    load_strategy: "SELECTIVE_LOAD"
```

### Load Strategies
- **FULL_LOAD** — Load ALL files in the directory
- **SELECTIVE_LOAD** — Load specific files using template variables
- **INDEX_GUIDED** — Load index.md, analyze structure, intelligently load relevant docs

---

## Smart Document Discovery Protocol

When a workflow invokes the `discover_inputs` protocol:

1. **Parse** input_file_patterns from workflow.yaml
2. **Try sharded documents first** — check for directory-based document splits
3. **Fall back to whole documents** — single file versions
4. **Handle not found gracefully** — set content variable to empty, note as unavailable
5. **Report discovery results** — list all loaded content variables with file counts

## Party Mode

Party Mode enables multi-agent group discussions. Any workflow checkpoint can launch Party Mode where all agents participate with their unique perspectives.

### Protocol
- ALL agent dialogue MUST use format: `Name (Role): dialogue`
- Create natural back-and-forth with user actively participating
- Show disagreements, diverse perspectives, authentic team dynamics
- 2-3 most relevant agents selected for balanced perspective
- User can exit Party Mode at any time to return to normal workflow

---

## Advanced Elicitation

At any workflow checkpoint, the user can invoke Advanced Elicitation to deep-dive into the current section using specialized techniques:

- Methods loaded from a CSV registry covering core, structural, risk, and creative categories
- 5 context-appropriate methods presented for selection
- Methods applied iteratively to enhance current content
- Enhanced content replaces original section in the output document
- User can reshuffle methods, list all, or proceed at any time
